# 📋 Pict'Oh - Implementation Plan

**Project**: Pict'Oh (pictoh)  
**Type**: Offline-first tablet application (React + TypeScript + Nx)  
**Created**: 2026-01-31

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

Pict'Oh is an offline-first, tablet-optimized communication board application built with React, TypeScript, and Material UI. The app displays a 6×4 grid of customizable squares that can contain pictures and associated text. Users can navigate between pages, and the app reads text aloud using local text-to-speech when squares are tapped.

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **State Management**: Valtio for simplicity and reactivity
2. **Persistence**: localStorage for immediate saves, IndexedDB if quota issues
3. **Offline**: Service Worker + Web Worker for downloads
4. **TTS**: Evaluate Web Speech API vs. local model (Piper/Coqui)
5. **Images**: Store in public assets, reference by path, all loaded on first access
6. **Build**: Nx for monorepo, Vite/Webpack for bundling
7. **Orientation**: Landscape-only (not portrait)
8. **Loading**: No lazy loading - everything loaded on first access
9. **IDE**: IntelliJ (not VS Code)
10. **Types**: Created alongside features (agile approach)

### Scalability Considerations

- Monorepo structure allows future Next.js backend
- Shared libraries for types and utilities
- State management can be extended for sync
- Picture library can be loaded from external source
- Pages/squares structure supports unlimited growth

### Performance Targets

- First Launch: < 30 seconds (with downloads, everything loaded before app is usable)
- Subsequent Loads: < 2 seconds
- Offline: 100% functional
- TTS Response: < 500ms delay
- Square Click Response: Immediate visual feedback
- Picture Search: < 100ms for filtering
- Navigation: Immediate (does not wait for TTS)

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: TTS Model Size
- **Mitigation**: Evaluate multiple TTS options, choose smallest viable model
- **Fallback**: Use Web Speech API if local model too large

### Risk: localStorage Quota Limits
- **Mitigation**: Implement IndexedDB fallback for large datasets
- **Fallback**: Warn user and implement data cleanup

### Risk: Browser Compatibility
- **Mitigation**: Target modern browsers, test on Safari and Chrome
- **Fallback**: Show unsupported browser message

### Risk: Picture Library Size
