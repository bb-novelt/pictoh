# Task 7.2: Page Creation

**Epic**: Epic 7: Page Management System

## Task Details

- [x] Implement `createPage(name)` function
- [x] Generate unique `pageId` (e.g., UUID or timestamp-based)
- [x] Validate unique page name (display name can be same, but warn user)
- [x] Initialize with 24 empty squares
- [x] Add to pages array in state
- [x] Navigate to new page immediately (by `pageId`)
- [x] Persist to localStorage

## Completion Summary

**Date Completed**: 2026-02-24

**Work Done**:

- `createPage(pageName, navigateToNew)` implemented in `src/state/actions/pageActions.ts` using `crypto.randomUUID()` for unique IDs.
- `CreatePageDialog` validates non-empty and unique page names before calling `createPage`.
- Page is immediately navigated to when `navigateToNew: true` is passed.
- Persistence is handled by Epic 9 (storage service); localStorage integration deferred to task 9.2.

**Notes**:

- Name uniqueness is enforced in the dialog UI (case-insensitive comparison). The action itself allows duplicate names with a console warning.
