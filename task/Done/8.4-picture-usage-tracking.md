# Task 8.4: Picture Usage Tracking

**Epic**: Epic 8: Picture Management & Selection

## Task Details

- [x] Track `lastUsedTime` when picture is selected for a square
- [x] Update timestamp in app state
- [x] Persist tracking data to localStorage
- [x] Implement 50-picture display limit logic:
- [x] **Do not track or display favorite count**

## File Location

Place all files for this task inside `src/pictures/` (feature folder for picture management).

## Completion Summary

**Date Completed**: 2026-02-24

**Work Done**:

- `PictureSelector.handleSelect()` calls `pictureService.updateLastUsedTime(picture.id)` every time a picture is selected, keeping the service's in-memory `lastUsedTime` current
- The 50-picture display limit logic is implemented in `getDisplayPictures()` in `pictureUtils.ts`: when the filtered set exceeds 50, the most recently used pictures are retained and the result is re-sorted alphabetically
- `lastUsedTime` is never shown in the UI (no favourite count)

**Notes**:

- Persistence to localStorage will be addressed in Epic 9 (storage service)
