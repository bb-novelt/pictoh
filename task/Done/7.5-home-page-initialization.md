# Task 7.5: Home Page Initialization

**Epic**: Epic 7: Page Management System

## Task Details

- [x] Create default Home page on first launch
- [x] Generate unique `homePageId`
- [x] Set as `homePageId` in config
- [x] Set as `currentPageId` on app load
- [x] Ensure Home page cannot be deleted (check by `pageId`)
- [x] Ensure Home page can be renamed (update `pageName` only)

## Completion Summary

**Date Completed**: 2026-02-24

**Work Done**:

- Default "Home" page created in `initializeStore()` in `src/state/store.ts` using `crypto.randomUUID()` for `homePageId`.
- `homePageId` and `currentPageId` both set to the Home page ID at startup.
- `deletePage()` blocks deletion when `pageId === store.homePageId`.
- `ManagePagesDialog` disables the delete button for the home page in the UI.
- Home page rename works normally through `renamePage()`.

**Notes**:

- All functionality was already in place from earlier tasks (2.2, 2.3). This task confirmed and validated the existing implementation.
