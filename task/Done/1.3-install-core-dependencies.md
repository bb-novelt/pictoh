# Task 1.3: Install Core Dependencies

**Epic**: Epic 1: Project Initialization & Infrastructure Setup

## Task Details

- [x] Install Material UI (`@mui/material`, `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`)
- [x] Install Material Icons (`@mui/icons-material`)
- [x] Install Tailwind CSS and configure
- [x] Install Valtio for state management
- [x] Install type definitions for all packages

## Completion Summary

**Date Completed**: 2026-02-15

**Work Done**:
- Installed Material UI v7.3.8 with required Emotion dependencies (@emotion/react, @emotion/styled)
- Installed Material Icons v7.3.8 for iconography
- Installed Tailwind CSS v4.1.18 with PostCSS and Autoprefixer
- Configured Tailwind CSS v4 by adding `@import "tailwindcss"` to styles.css (v4 uses CSS-based configuration)
- Installed Valtio v2.3.0 for state management
- All TypeScript type definitions are included with the packages (Material UI and Valtio include their own types)
- Verified successful installation by building the pictho-app with `npx nx build pictho-app`

**Notes**:
- Tailwind CSS v4 uses a different configuration approach than v3 - it now uses CSS imports (`@import "tailwindcss"`) instead of a JavaScript config file
- All dependencies installed as production dependencies except Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer which are dev dependencies
- Build completed successfully, confirming all dependencies are properly configured
- All packages are at their latest stable versions
