# Task 4.3: Square Component

**Epic**: Epic 4: Main Grid Layout & Basic UI

## Task Details

- [x] Create `Square` component
- [x] Props: `square: Square`, `onClick: () => void`, `isEditMode: boolean`
- [x] Display selected picture (if any)
- [x] Display text above picture (if configured)
- [x] Style empty squares differently
- [x] Add visual feedback on touch (not release):
- [x] **Edit mode visual feedback**:
- [x] No ARIA labels needed (not for blind people)
- [x] No hover effects (tablet-only)

## File Location

Place all files for this task inside `src/grid/` (feature folder for grid/layout).
Example: `src/grid/Square.tsx`

## Completion Summary

**Date Completed**: 2026-02-22

**Work Done**:

- Updated `apps/pictho-app/src/grid/Square.tsx`:
  - Added `onClick: () => void` and `isEditMode: boolean` props
  - On `touchStart`: fires `onClick()` and sets `touched` state for 1 second, rendering a blue (`primary.main`) border as visual feedback
  - In edit mode: renders a persistent red (`error.main`) border on all squares
  - In edit mode: also wires `onClick` to the `onClick` DOM event so mouse clicks work on desktop for testing
  - Empty squares (no `selectedPicture`) use `grey.100` background; squares with a picture use `background.paper`
  - No hover effects added (tablet-only device)
  - No ARIA labels added

- Updated `apps/pictho-app/src/grid/Grid.tsx`:
  - Passes `isEditMode={snap.isEditMode}` and `onClick={() => {}}` (placeholder — will be wired to actions in later tasks) to each `<Square />`

**Notes**:

- The `onClick` handler in `Grid` is a no-op placeholder. Tasks 5.x will connect it to TTS playback and navigation logic.
- Touch feedback uses a 1-second `setTimeout` as specified in the project overview.
