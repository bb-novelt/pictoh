# Task 2.1: Define TypeScript Types (created alongside features)

**Epic**: Epic 2: Core Data Models & State Management

## Task Details

- [x] Create types as needed when implementing features
- [x] Define `Picture` interface when implementing picture feature
- [x] Define `Square` interface when implementing grid feature
- [x] Define `Page` interface when implementing page management
- [x] Define `AppConfig` interface when implementing app state

## Completion Summary

**Date Completed**: 2026-02-15

**Work Done**:

- Created `/apps/pictho-app/src/types/index.ts` with core TypeScript interfaces
- Defined `Picture` interface with properties:
  - `id`: unique identifier
  - `text`: display name/text for the picture
  - `src`: path or URL to the picture file
  - `isUserAdded`: flag to distinguish user-added vs built-in pictures
  - `lastUsedTime`: optional timestamp for tracking usage (needed for 50-picture limit)
- Defined `Square` interface with properties:
  - `position`: index in the grid (0-23)
  - `selectedPicture`: reference to Picture or null for empty squares
  - `associatedText`: text to be read aloud via TTS
  - `displayTextAbovePicture`: boolean flag for text display
  - `openPageId`: ID of page to navigate to (empty string = no navigation)
- Defined `Page` interface with properties:
  - `pageId`: unique identifier (used as key, not pageName)
  - `pageName`: display name (can be renamed)
  - `squares`: fixed array of 24 squares (6x4 grid)
- Defined `AppConfig` interface with properties:
  - `homePageId`: ID of the home page
  - `currentPageId`: ID of the currently active page
  - `pages`: array of all pages
  - `isEditMode`: flag for edit mode state
- Verified types compile successfully with TypeScript compiler
- Verified build succeeds with `npx nx build pictho-app`

**Notes**:

- All interfaces align with PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md specifications
- Types use `pageId` as unique identifier (not `pageName`) to allow renaming without breaking references
- Picture interface includes `lastUsedTime` for implementing the 50-picture display limit feature
- All properties are fully documented with JSDoc comments for better IDE support
- Types are ready for use in upcoming state management tasks (2.2 and 2.3)
