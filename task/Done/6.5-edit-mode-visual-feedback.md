# Task 6.5: Edit Mode Visual Feedback

**Epic**: Epic 6: Edit Mode & Configuration

## Task Details

- [ ] Add visual indicators for edit mode
- [ ] **All squares show red borders** when edit mode is active
- [ ] Highlight editable areas
- [ ] All squares are editable when in edit mode
- [ ] No hover effects (tablet-only app)

## File Location

Place all files for this task inside `src/editMode/` (feature folder for edit mode).

## Completion Summary

**Date Completed**: 2026-02-24

**Work Done**:

- Edit mode visual feedback was already implemented in `apps/pictho-app/src/grid/Square.tsx`
  as part of the Task 4.3 / Task 6.1 work:
  - `Square` component accepts an `isEditMode: boolean` prop
  - When `isEditMode` is `true`, all squares display a **red border** (`error.main`)
  - When a square is touched in normal mode, it flashes a **blue border** for 1 second
  - In normal mode (no touch), squares show a subtle **grey border** (`grey.300`) so
    all 24 squares are visible including empty ones
  - No hover effects are present (tablet-only app)
- `Grid.tsx` passes `snap.isEditMode` down to every `Square`
- Tapping a square in edit mode opens `SquareEditModal` (making all squares editable)

**Screenshots**:

Normal mode — grey borders on all 24 squares (including empty):

**Notes**:

- No new files were required; the feature was already complete in `Square.tsx`
- This task file was not moved to Done at the time of implementation, so it is
  being closed now after verification
