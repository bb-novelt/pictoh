# Task 1.2: Create React Frontend Application

**Epic**: Epic 1: Project Initialization & Infrastructure Setup

## Task Details

- [x] Generate React app using Nx generator
- [x] Configure app for tablet-only viewport
- [x] Set landscape orientation lock in manifest/config
- [x] Remove unnecessary boilerplate files

## Completion Summary

**Date Completed**: 2026-02-14

**Work Done**:

- React app already generated in Task 1.1 (apps/pictho-app)
- Configured index.html for tablet-only viewport:
  - Updated viewport meta tag with `maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no`
  - Added iOS-specific meta tags for web app capability
  - Changed language to French (`lang="fr"`)
  - Updated title to "Pict'Oh"
- Created manifest.json for PWA and landscape orientation:
  - Set `orientation: "landscape"` to lock landscape mode
  - Configured as standalone app
  - Set French language
  - Added theme colors
- Removed unnecessary boilerplate files:
  - Deleted `nx-welcome.tsx` (Nx welcome component)
  - Deleted `app.spec.tsx` (will add proper tests later)
  - Removed React Router imports and routing code from `app.tsx`
  - Simplified `main.tsx` by removing BrowserRouter wrapper
- Simplified App component to basic structure with French text

**Notes**:

- The app is now properly configured for tablet-only use in landscape orientation
- PWA manifest enables orientation lock through `orientation: "landscape"`
- Removed React Router as the app uses its own page navigation system
- Build verification completed successfully
- App is ready for further development of core features
