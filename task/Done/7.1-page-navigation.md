# Task 7.1: Page Navigation

**Epic**: Epic 7: Page Management System

## Task Details

- [x] Implement `navigateToPage(pageId)` function - navigate by ID
- [x] Update current page in state (`currentPageId`)
- [x] Render new page grid
- [x] No navigation history needed
- [x] Prevent navigation to non-existent pages
- [x] No page transition animations

## Completion Summary

**Date Completed**: 2026-02-24

**Work Done**:

- `navigateToPage(pageId)` implemented in `src/state/actions/pageActions.ts`; it verifies the page exists before updating `store.currentPageId`.
- `Grid` component reads `store.currentPageId` via Valtio snapshot and re-renders the correct page squares automatically.
- Navigation guards log a warning and bail out for unknown IDs.
- No navigation history or transition animations added.

**Notes**:

- All functionality was already in place from earlier tasks (2.2, 2.3, 4.2). This task confirmed and validated the existing implementation.
