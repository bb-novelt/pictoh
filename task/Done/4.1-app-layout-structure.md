# Task 4.1: App Layout Structure

**Epic**: Epic 4: Main Grid Layout & Basic UI

## Task Details

- [ ] Create `Layout` component with landscape lock
- [ ] Set up viewport meta tags for tablet
- [ ] Configure for landscape-only (not portrait, not phone, not desktop)
- [ ] Ensure proper touch target sizes (min 44×44px)

## File Location

Place all files for this task inside `src/grid/` (feature folder for grid/layout).
Example: `src/grid/Layout.tsx`

## Completion Summary

**Date Completed**: 2026-02-20

**Work Done**:

- Created `apps/pictho-app/src/grid/Layout.tsx` — new `Layout` component that:
  - Fills the full viewport (`100dvw` × `100dvh`) in landscape mode
  - Displays a full-screen "Veuillez tourner votre tablette en mode paysage" overlay with a rotation icon when the device is in portrait orientation (CSS `@media (orientation: portrait)`)
  - Hides the app content (`visibility: hidden`) in portrait mode so nothing is usable until rotated
  - Sets a `--min-touch-target: 44px` CSS custom property and applies `minWidth`/`minHeight` to all `button` and `[role="button"]` descendants
- Updated `apps/pictho-app/src/app/app.tsx` to wrap the main app content inside `<Layout>`
- Viewport meta tags (`user-scalable=no`, `maximum-scale=1.0`) and PWA manifest `"orientation": "landscape"` were already in place from Epic 3

**Notes**:

- Portrait lock is achieved via CSS media query rather than the Screen Orientation API to keep the solution simple and broadly compatible
- The `grid/` feature folder was created as specified in the task; future Grid and Square components will live here
