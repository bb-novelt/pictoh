# Task 4.2: Grid Component

**Epic**: Epic 4: Main Grid Layout & Basic UI

## Task Details

- [x] Create `Grid` component (6 columns × 4 rows)
- [x] Use CSS Grid or MUI Grid for layout
- [x] Ensure squares scale to fill space but stay square
- [x] Add rounded corners to squares
- [x] Implement responsive padding/gaps
- [x] Handle different tablet sizes gracefully

## File Location

Place all files for this task inside `src/grid/` (feature folder for grid/layout).
Example: `src/grid/Grid.tsx`

## Completion Summary

**Date Completed**: 2026-02-22

**Work Done**:

- Created `apps/pictho-app/src/grid/Square.tsx` — individual square cell that:
  - Uses `aspect-ratio: 1 / 1` to stay perfectly square at any size
  - Has `border-radius: 2` (MUI theme spacing, ~8 px) for rounded corners
  - Shows the selected picture (with optional text above/below) when set
  - Renders as an empty grey placeholder when no picture is selected

- Created `apps/pictho-app/src/grid/Grid.tsx` — 6×4 grid layout that:
  - Reads the current page squares from the Valtio store via `useSnapshot`
  - Uses CSS Grid (`repeat(6, 1fr)` columns × `repeat(4, 1fr)` rows)
  - Constrains the grid with `aspect-ratio: 6/4` so squares always stay square
  - Keeps it within both viewport dimensions using `max-width: 100%` + `max-height: 100%`
  - Uses a percentage-based gap (`0.5%`) so spacing scales proportionally on all tablet sizes

- Updated `apps/pictho-app/src/app/app.tsx` to replace the placeholder `<div>` with `<Grid />`

**Notes**:

- Portrait→landscape rotation is handled by the existing `Layout` wrapper (Task 4.1); `Grid` assumes it always renders in landscape
- The gap is expressed as a percentage of the grid width so it adapts to any tablet screen size without media queries
