# Task 6.0: Default App Content

**Epic**: Epic 6: Edit Mode & Configuration

## Context

The app currently initializes with a single empty Home page. To make the app
immediately usable and testable (before any content is manually entered in edit
mode), the initial state should be pre-populated with a realistic set of default
pages and squares.

## Task Details

### Home Page — 3 pre-configured squares

- [ ] Square at position 0: picture `manger.svg`, associated text `"Manger"`,
      `displayTextAbovePicture: true`, navigation link (`openPageId`) pointing to the
      **Repas** page
- [ ] Square at position 1: picture `chat.svg`, associated text `"Chat"`,
      `displayTextAbovePicture: true`, no navigation link
- [ ] Square at position 2: picture `maison.svg`, no text (`associatedText: ''`,
      `displayTextAbovePicture: false`), no navigation link

### Repas Page — 3 pre-configured squares

- [ ] Create a second default page named **"Repas"** added to the initial store
- [ ] Square at position 0: picture `eau.svg`, associated text `"Eau"`,
      `displayTextAbovePicture: true`
- [ ] Square at position 1: picture `arbre.svg`, no text
- [ ] Square at position 2: picture `soleil.svg`, associated text `"Soleil"`,
      `displayTextAbovePicture: true`

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] Modify `initializeStore()` in `apps/pictho-app/src/state/store.ts` to
      create both pages and configure the squares as described above
- [ ] Picture paths must use the format already used in the codebase
      (e.g. `"/assets/pictures/manger.svg"`)
- [ ] The `openPageId` for the navigation square on the Home page must reference
      the **Repas** page's `pageId` (set up during the same `initializeStore()` call)
- [ ] All other squares on both pages remain empty (24 squares per page total)
- [ ] Existing behaviour (Home page cannot be deleted, `homePageId` /
      `currentPageId` set correctly) must be preserved

## File Location

All changes for this task are inside `apps/pictho-app/src/state/store.ts`.
No new files need to be created.

## Implementation Hints

- `createPage(pageName)` and `createEmptySquare(position)` already exist in
  `store.ts` — use them as the basis for building the default pages.
- After creating both pages with `createPage()`, patch the specific squares by
  index (e.g. `repasPage.squares[0].selectedPicture = '/assets/pictures/eau.svg'`)
  before returning the `AppConfig` from `initializeStore()`.
- Set `openPageId` on the Home square to `repasPage.pageId` **after** the Repas
  page has been created so the reference is valid.
