# Task 5.4: Navigation Logic

**Epic**: Epic 5: Square Interaction & TTS Integration

## Task Details

- [ ] Implement page navigation on square touch
- [ ] Navigate by `pageId` (not `pageName`)
- [ ] Trigger navigation immediately (do not wait for TTS)
- [ ] Handle navigation to non-existent pages
- [ ] No page transition animations
- [ ] No navigation history

## File Location

Navigation logic belongs in `src/state/actions/` (already feature-based state folder).
No new feature folder is needed unless significant new UI is added.
